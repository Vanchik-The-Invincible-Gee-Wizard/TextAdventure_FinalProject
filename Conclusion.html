      <h1> You Walk Back Inside the Doors </h1>
      <p> Seeing as you are thoroughly confused about what just happened and are ready to fall into bed and stare at the ceiling contemplatively for a good couple hours, <br>
      it takes you by surprise to see a gathering of professors waiting for you inside. They rush to you, checking to make sure you're alright, and Headmistress McGonagall <br>
    takes the diary from your hands. They are all speaking at once and you can't understand. You look down to find your crazy cat, ready to blame everything on it, when you find it gone. <br>
    In its place is a black haired student, a 7th year from the looks of it. She has the same green eyes as your cat, and you are beginning to connect the dots. You turn to Headmistress McGonagall <br>
  to ask, but she beats you to it. She tells you that the diary was very important to them, and they had been looking for it for a while. She did not appreciate your cat (the animagus?) taking <br>
another student into the Forbidden Forest to find it, but apparently you were the only one who could. With that vague answer and a promise to fill you in with more information in the morning, she <br>
she sends you to your dorm. You agree, and fall asleep knowing you will have answers tomorrow. </p> <br> <br>
<p> The End. </p>

      <h1> You chose to Enter the Forest. </h1>
      <p> Your cat, who can apparently talk, once again turns away and runs into the forest. You run after it, casting lumos maxima to light up your wand. </p>
      <p> It occurs to you that your cat must be an animagus; a human who can transform into an animal. After all, they were able to apparate and speak. </p>
      <p> Seeing a dark shape descending in front of you, you skid to a stop. An acromantula lands in front of you, and you whisk out your wand.</p>
      <p> Which spell do you cast? </p>
